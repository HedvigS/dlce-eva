# Shell/working on the command line

While working with the shell or command line might seem intimidating at first,
working in a terminal environment has a number of benefits (e.g. when compared
to working with graphical user interfaces):

- steps to produce certain outputs (for example manipulating data files) are
  much easier to reproduce, thereby leading to more reproducible analyses
- different tools can be combined (keyword: piping)
- support is easier since entering commands in a terminal and getting an output
  is more deterministic than using GUIs

# Git

Git is a version control system used to track changes in files. Git uses
metadata (who changed what when where) to keep a history of all the changes made
in a repository. Git is a distributed version control system and allows
repositories to live locally and remotely (i.e. if you clone one of our
repositories from GitHub you'll have a local clone and remote repository still
living on GitHub).

## Tutorials and guides

We can highly recommend the Software Carpentry lessons on [Version control with
Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Those will introduce you to the
basic commands required for the essential Git workflow.

[Here](https://pad.gwdg.de/p/ByBc2xHEU#/) you can find a presentation (based off
the Software Carpentry lessons) that distills the basics even further.

## Essential commands

While working through the guides, be on the lookout for the following essential
commands:

- `git init`: Initialize a repository locally.
- `git clone`: Clone ('download') a repository from a remote location.
- `git pull`: Update a repository from a remote repository.
- `git push`: Push local changes to a remote repository.
- `git status`: Get an overview of the status of a repository.
- `git add`: Add files to the staging area (prepare files for a commit).
- `git commit`: Commit files (cementing their changes into a repositories
  history)
- `git log`: Get an overview of the history of a repository.
- `git diff`: Get an overview of the changes made to a file.

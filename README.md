# RDM at DLCE MPI EVA

Research data management at the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution of the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology

## Environment

RDM at DLCE is based on a handful of foundational tools and principles:
- [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org) is used as the standard exchange format for all our data - in most cases it is
  used as storage format as well, and in many cases even as primary or raw format.
- Data management tools are typically implemented as Python packages.
- Curation history for our data is maintained by using the `git` version control tool to manage the raw data.
